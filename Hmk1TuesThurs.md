Instructions: Complete the exercises below. Circle your answers clearly where appropriate. Make sure your homework is legible. Handwritten assignments should be scanned to a single pdf file (the TurboScan phone app works well for this purpose.) You may discuss strategies with classmates, but all work submitted must be your own. Work done in R may be submitted as a separate html file or included in the pdf as you see fit.

Due date:

**Mon/Wed class**: Wed, Jan. 31, at 11:59pm

**Tues/Thurs class** Tues, Jan 30, at 11:59pm

Lateness policy:

Assignments will NOT be accepted after 24 hours past the due date. (You are allowed one assignment late but within 24 hours of the due date without penalty. All other late assignments will result in a deduction of 4 points.)
